## Emma Albury

I am full-stack junior web developer. I am obsessed with learning and exploration. Considering the endless learning, possibilities, and challenges we must face as developers, I feel it's a perfect occupation for me.

I believe technology can be used as a powerful tool for the advancement of all. I feel passionately about creating content that is more diverse and inclusive and more importantly, playing my part in clearing space, creating opportunities and encouraging a culture where minorities can become developers themselves. The future is looking increasingly tech focused and I want to play a part in making that future a beautiful one.
