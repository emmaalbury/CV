## Emma Albury

I am Full-Stack Junior Web Developer. I am obsessed with learning and exploration (see my extensive education and travel destinations). Considering the endless learning, possibilities, and challenges we must face as Developers, I feel it's a perfect occupation for me.

I believe technology can be used as a powerful tool for the advancement of all. I feel pasionately about creating content that is more diverse and inclusive and more importantly, playing my part in clearing space, creating opportunities and a culture where minorities can become Developers themselves so that they can reap the benefits of such positions and create content that suits a more diverse range of wants and needs. The future is looking increasingly tech focused and I want play a part in making that future a beautiful one.

## Skills

### Inituative
- I rarely do things the conventional way. Instead I try to find paths that I am more likely to excel at and make decisions from a place of creativity, originality and innovation. This often requires diving into the deep-end, trusting my inituative and calling on my vast skill set. An example of this is when I worked for Imagine Education in 2007. Instead of hiring me for a specific role, they hired me to fullfill specific requirements. To meet these requirements I created the role of Tour Group/ Home Stay Coordinator and ESL (English as a Second Language) Teacher. It was a multifacteted job and I had to create my own schedules, curriculum, deadlines, methods and means of managing and liasoning with all bodies involved. It required a lot of juggling, swift decisions making and organisation. Not only did I fullfill all the requirements expected of me, but I also manage to please all bodies involved. 

### Integrity
- I have strong ethics and morals and believe in acting of services to others or causes aside from self (as you can see below with my volunteer work). I try to always act from a place of compassion, kindness and respect. I have always had a very good relationship with my employers and collegues as I try to always do what's best for the team and will always put in the effort to do the best job I can for you.

### Inquisitive
- I study, travel, read and paticipate in experiences to constantly learn more about aspects of the world and myself. I don't ever want to stop learning. I am passionate about being a developer as it brings new challenges and teachings into my life every day. I find the ways in which my studies and experiences interweave, fascinating and highly benefitial. My previous Degrees may not have lead to a career in those specific fields. And yet none of them were a waste as aspects of those teachings influence and strengthen all other work I do.

### Perseverance 
- As you can see by all the Degrees and Certificates I have achieved, once I have started something and believe it is of worth, I stick in there to see it through to completion. No matter how challenging I find it. A good example of this is when I completed an Intensive Chemistry course (within my Masters). I had never studied chemistry before and here I was needing to keep up at Masters level! I love a challenge and have the determination to complete whatever I have commited myself to. You can depend on me to get the job done. 

### Balanced
- I dedicate myself to a work/play balance. By taking time out to do yoga, meditate, do some travel, spend some time in nature, go out dancing, see some inspiring art etc I can revitalise myself and immerse myself fully in the work task at hand with complete contentment. I'm very good at moderating and monitoring myself to reach this balance. As you can see by my work and education achievements, this balance leads to great productivity.

## Education


#### Makers Academy (2018)

Developer Bootcamp, Makers Academy, London United Kingdom.

#### I'm not afraid of a challenge:
I knew my idea for our final project at Makers was a lot to bite off. But I feel passionately about learning and creating things with a positive purpose, and I felt this was the perfect opportunity to do both. We had never built a mobile app before, nor used any of the languages and frameworks we were implementing (React Native, Expo, Jest and Enzyme). But through awesome team work and a lot of hard work and passion, we were able to teach ourselves and in two short weeks successfully created a mobile app that helps people with disabilities and other mobility concerns find the best routes to navigate around London https://github.com/emmaalbury/made-to-help.

#### I can be relied upon to complete tasks independently:
In one group project at Makers I was designated the task of setting up continuous deployment. I was able to configure a pipeline from our local servers, to our Github repo, through Travis CI, to deploy from Heroku. I had a lot of trouble debugging some authentication issues, but eventually set it up to be passing builds and successfully deploying. After I had set this up, I gave a mini tutorial to my other team mates who were interested in learning about it. With the assistance of this knowledge, they were then able to take it further when our coach, acting as a mock “client” requested a migration from Heroku to AWS. They did an excellent job of this and I believe I contributed by configuring the initial set up and teaching them the ropes with Heroku. I also made sure I was available to assist them and offer any answers they had throughout this process. Here is a repo of that project https://github.com/emmaalbury/Team-Tela

#### I get a kick out of debugging:
I actually quite enjoy the dissecting and excavational quality of debugging. I'm a curious person so I like trying to figure out what has gone wrong and why. Instead of fearing red, I consider error messages to be very handy hints (especially when using them as guidence in the TDD process). Here is an exercise exhibiting my debugging skills http://github.com/emmaalbury/Debugging. My usual methodology for debugging is detailed in exercise 4.

#### I am comfortable programming using:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React Native
- RSpec, Jasmine, Jest, Enzyme
