## Emma Albury

I am full-stack junior web developer. I am obsessed with learning and exploration. Considering the endless learning, possibilities, and challenges we must face as developers, I feel it's a perfect occupation for me.

I believe technology can be used as a powerful tool for the advancement of all. I feel passionately about creating content that is more diverse and inclusive and more importantly, playing my part in clearing space, creating opportunities and encouraging a culture where minorities can become developers themselves. The future is looking increasingly tech focused and I want to play a part in making that future a beautiful one.

| Name | Description | Technology | Skill |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| https://github.com/emmaalbury/made-to-help  | A mobile app that helps find the best, and most accessible, routes for those who need help navigating the city.  | React Native, Expo, Jest, Enzyme, Detox | I recognise the fundamental recurring concepts between most languages and frameworks I encounter. Due to this I was able, with my team, to write a fairly complex program using a new language, React Native and all new testing frameworks within a short two weeks.  |
| https://github.com/emmaalbury/Team-Tela  | A social media platform allowing user to sign up, sign in, post, like and comment on user content.  | Rails, Devise, Travis CI, Heroku, AWS, Rubocop, Simplecov  | I was designated the task of setting up continuous deployment. I configured a pipeline from our local servers, to our Github repo and through Travis CI to deploy from Heroku. After I set this up, I gave a tutorial to my team mates. They were then able to migrate from Heroku to AWS as later requested by our "client" (I took over their role of writing CRUD methods so they could learn to deploy). They did an excellent job of this and I believe I contributed by configuring the initial set up and teaching them the ropes. I ensured I was available to assist them throughout this process. |
| https://github.com/emmaalbury/Kangaroo_MakersAirBnb (there are not many commits under my name as my computer broke during the project so we made commits under my partner's name, NadiaAiraf).  | A replica of AirBnB. Allows users to sign up, sign in, list and book accomodation.  | Node.js, Zombie, Jasmine, MongoDB  | One task I was asigned with during this project was setting up testing frameworks that were new to me. I suceeded in this. I received feedback from teamates who found me to be very supportive, positive and motivated, with strong compliance to agile software development. |
| https://github.com/emmaalbury/bank_tech_test | A REPL bank program with which users can make financial deposits, withdrawals, see their balance and print a statement.  |  Ruby, RSpec, Simplecov, Rubocop | This is a program I built adhereing strictly to TDD and refactoring to make it as clean and simple to build and use as possible. For example, I renamed methods to make them clearer and refactored the program to allow methods to accept input as arguments instead of using statements. I utilise TDD in my process as it enables me to break down problems into small steps and guides my workflow. |
