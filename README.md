## Emma Albury

I am Full-Stack Junior Web Developer. I am obsessed with learning and exploration. Considering the endless learning, possibilities, and challenges we must face as Developers, I feel it's a perfect occupation for me.

I believe technology can be used as a powerful tool for the advancement of all. I feel passionately about creating content that is more diverse and inclusive and more importantly, playing my part in clearing space, creating opportunities and a culture where minorities can become Developers themselves so that they can reap the benefits of such positions and create content that suits a more diverse range of wants and needs. The future is looking increasingly tech focused and I want play a part in making that future a beautiful one.

## Skills

### Integrity
- I have strong ethics and morals and believe in acting of services to others or causes aside from self. I try to always act from a place of compassion, kindness and respect. I have always had a very good relationship with my employers and colleagues as I try to always do what's best for the team and will always put in the effort to do the best job I can for you.

### Inquisitive
- I study, travel, read and participate in experiences to constantly learn more about aspects of the world and myself. I don't ever want to stop learning. I am passionate about being a developer as it brings new challenges and teachings into my life every day. I find the ways in which my studies and experiences interweave, fascinating and highly beneficial. My previous degrees may not have lead to a career in those specific fields, yet none of them were a waste as aspects of those teachings influence and strengthen all other work I do.

### Logical
- While I’m a big fan of being open-minded, adventurous and thinking outside the box, I’m also very logical. For example, I encouraged our final group project team at Makers to use props when passing data between files instead of using Redux as through research I found a reoccurring opinion that Redux was mostly used for bigger projects and as we were working on a smaller project and were running out of time, learning a new technology was not the best idea.  https://github.com/emmaalbury/made-to-help. A teammate on that project gave me the following feedback: "Emma and I paired a lot during our final projects. For 2 days, we were stuck on how to move information from one file to another. We did some research separately to figure out the best way to do it. We found two ways to do it: the first one is through props and the second one is with Redux. After some research, Emma explained to me why using the props was a better option for our project. She believed that Redux was mostly used for bigger projects and as we were running out of time, learning a new technology was not the best idea. She shared with me the resources she found on how to use props in order to move data across different files. After that, we managed to do it successfully.  She was really good at making sure that I understood why she thought going with props was a better option in that case." Saying that, I’d like to learn more about and utilise Redux in the future.

### Initiative
- I don’t stick to things just for conventions sake. Instead I am adaptable and try to make decisions best suited to each situation, delivering from a place of creativity, originality, and innovation. This often requires diving into the deep-end, trusting my initiative and calling on my vast skill set. An example of this is when I worked for Imagine Education in 2007. Instead of hiring me for a specific role, they hired me to fulfill specific requirements. To meet these requirements I created the role of Tour Group/ Homestay Coordinator and ESL (English as a Second Language) Teacher. It was a multifaceted job and I had to create my own schedules, curriculum, deadlines, methods and means of managing and liasoning with all bodies involved. It required a lot of juggling, swift decisions making and organisation. Not only did I fulfill all the requirements expected of me, but I also manage to please all bodies involved. 

### Perseverance 
- As you can see by all the degrees and certificates I have achieved, once I have started something and believe it is of worth, I stick in there to see it through to completion. No matter how challenging I find it. A good example of this is when I completed an Intensive Chemistry course (within my Masters). I had never studied chemistry before and here I was needing to keep up at Masters level! I love a challenge and have the determination to complete whatever I have committed myself to. You can depend on me to get the job done. A teammate at Makers gave me the following feedback:  “I think your perseverance was really good, managing to get zombie working with JS whilst I think most of the rest of us were playing around with CSS.” See the relevant project https://github.com/emmaalbury/Kangaroo_MakersAirBnb. A member from another team I was a part of said: “Your positivity through the week was impressive when setup was getting us all down.”,

### Balanced
- I dedicate myself to a work/play balance. By taking time out to do yoga, meditate, do some travel, spend some time in nature, go out dancing, see some inspiring art etc I can revitalise myself and immerse myself fully in the work task at hand with complete contentment. I'm very good at moderating and monitoring myself to reach this balance. Even in the midst of the most intense periods at Makers I would meditate daily and practice yoga multiple times a week. As you can see by my work and education achievements, this balance leads to great productivity.

## Developer Specific Skills

#### I'm not afraid of a challenge:
I knew my idea for our final project at Makers was a lot to bite off. But I feel passionately about learning and creating things with a positive purpose and this was the perfect opportunity to do both. We had never built a mobile app before, nor used any of the languages and frameworks we were implementing (React Native, Expo, Jest and Enzyme). But through awesome teamwork and a lot of hard work and passion, we were able to teach ourselves and in two short weeks successfully created a mobile app that helps people with disabilities and other mobility concerns find the best routes to navigate around London https://github.com/emmaalbury/made-to-help.

#### I can be relied upon to complete tasks independently:
In one group project at Makers I was designated the task of setting up continuous deployment. I was able to configure a pipeline from our local servers, to our Github repo, through Travis CI, to deploy from Heroku. I had a lot of trouble debugging some authentication issues, but eventually set it up to be passing builds and successfully deploying. After I had set this up, I gave a mini tutorial to my other team mates who were interested in learning about it. With the assistance of this knowledge, they were then able to take it further when our coach, acting as a mock “client” requested a migration from Heroku to AWS. They did an excellent job of this and I believe I contributed by configuring the initial set up and teaching them the ropes with Heroku. I also made sure I was available to assist them and offer any answers they had throughout this process. Here is a repo of that project https://github.com/emmaalbury/Team-Tela

#### I get a kick out of debugging:
I actually quite enjoy the dissecting and excavational quality of debugging. I'm a curious person so I like trying to figure out what has gone wrong and why. Instead of fearing red, I consider error messages to be very handy hints (especially when using them as guidance in the TDD process). Here is an exercise exhibiting my debugging skills http://github.com/emmaalbury/Debugging. My usual methodology for debugging is detailed in Exercise 4.

#### I am comfortable programming using:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React Native
- RSpec, Jasmine, Capybara, Jest, Enzyme
- Travis CI
- Heroku and have some experience with AWS
