## Emma Albury

I have been driven to become a full-stack junior web developer by my obsession with learning and exploration. In light of the endlessly evolving possibilities and challenges we encounter as developers, I feel it's a perfect occupation for me.

I believe technology can be harnessed for the advancement of all. I feel passionately about creating content that is more diverse and inclusive, playing my part in clearing space, creating opportunities and encouraging a culture where minorities can take their place in the new future our technologies are forging.

| Name | Description | Technology | Skill |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [MADE to Help](https://github.com/emmaalbury/made-to-help) | A mobile app that helps find the fastest and most accessible routes for those who need help navigating the city.  | React Native, Expo, Jest, Enzyme, Detox | Together with my team, I drew on my familiarity with the concepts and structures that underlie most frameworks to build a complex program using tools unknown to us all – React Native and new testing frameworks – within two weeks.  |
| [Tela](https://github.com/emmaalbury/Team-Tela) | A social media platform allowing users to sign up, sign in, post, like and comment on user content.  | Rails, Devise, Travis CI, Heroku, AWS, Rubocop, Simplecov  | I was designated the task of setting up continuous deployment. I configured a pipeline from our local servers to our Github repo and through Travis CI to deploy from Heroku. After I set this up, I gave a tutorial to my teammates. They were then able to migrate from Heroku to AWS as later requested by our "client"; while they learned the deployment process, I took over their role of writing CRUD methods so they could learn the deployment process and provided support where necessary. |
| [Kangaroo Makers AirBnB](https://github.com/emmaalbury/Kangaroo_MakersAirBnb) | A replica of AirBnB. Allows users to sign up and in, and list and book accomodation.  | Node.js, Zombie, Jasmine, MongoDB  | Among other tasks, I set up the testing frameworks for this project. I received feedback from teammates that I was supportive, positive and motivated, with strong compliance to agile software development. Note: due to a computer failure, most of my commits are under my partner's name, NadiaAiraf.|
| [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/emmaalbury/bank_tech_test) | A REPL bank program enabling users to make financial deposits and withdrawals, see their balance and print a statement.  |  Ruby, RSpec, Simplecov, Rubocop | I developed this program adhering strictly to TDD, and refactored the code to make it as clean and simple to build and use as possible. I utilise TDD in my process as it enables me to break problems down into small steps, and guides my workflow. |


### Work Experience

I have carved out a rich and varied professional history, over the course of which I have acquired skills such as:

  - applying precise technical methodology and creative problem solving, and work documentation, in roles such as conservator of cultural materials for museums including Mexico's National Museum of Anthropology.
  
  -  working to briefs and meeting strict deadlines in teams or with designated solo tasks, in roles like art handler for galleries and museums such as the National Gallery of Victoria.
  
- flexibility, teamwork, thriving in male-dominated industries and sustaining motivation and positivity through long and challenging shifts as a freelance audiovisual technician for companies such as Gig Power, Australia.

- teaching and leadership skills, constructing and adhering to plans and schedules, managing and liasing with individuals and organisations as a tour group/homestay coordinator and English teacher in various schools such as Osaka English House, Japan, and as an assistant coach at Makers.

I have also worked in customer service, hospitality and retail and as a drama teacher. These industries strengthened my people skills and taught me how to make work fun.
